Designed and developed an interactive sales analytics dashboard inspired by Blinkit to analyze outlet performance, customer preferences, and product trends. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average customer ratings, enabling data-driven business insights.

Implemented dynamic filters for outlet location, outlet size, and outlet type, allowing users to drill down into specific segments. Visualized key metrics such as sales by outlet type and size, item category performance, fat content distribution, and outlet establishment trends over time using intuitive charts and KPIs.

The dashboard helps identify high-performing outlets, top-selling item categories, regional sales distribution (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), and customer rating patterns, supporting strategic decisions related to inventory planning, outlet expansion, and marketing optimization.
